# Sketch files to test the sensor with an Arduino Uno

Since the Arduino UNO has not enough RAM to include the MLX90640 Adafruit libraries,
these sketches can be used to test the sensor.

The files in this folder are copied from [jamesdanielv's project](https://github.com/jamesdanielv/thermal_cam_mlx90640) and not included via submodule, since the sketches are in zip archives.
